      <div class="essay">I was born in Daraa, Syria in 1989.
        This city is in the south of Syria near the border of Jordan.
        I lived there with my parents, two sisters, Nawar and Laila, and my brother Ayham.
        At university I studied Arabic Literature and also I took a vocational course in Marketing.</div>

      <div class="essay">The war started in 2011 during the first year of my study.
        The Free Syrian Army was actually founded in Daraa and I realized that after 2013 our
        living condition became more tough.
        For example, I could not study between 2013 and 2014.</div>

      <div class="essay">In 2014 my family decided to flee from Syria. My sister,
        Laila stayed there as she was already married.
        Except for her, we all went to Turkey in November by bus. </div>

      <div class="essay">However living in Switzerland was also difficult because of the bureaucracy.
        That’s why we decided to move to Berlin in 2015 - we just took just a Flixbus!</div>

      <div class="essay"> At the beginning, life in Berlin was also difficult.
        Things like learning a new language and finding an apartment for us.
        The five of us are still living in a Hotel with only two rooms.
        But still, I think living in Germany is not too bad in terms of safety and having freedom of opinion. I can see myself in the future still living in Berlin.
        Because I like big cities with many activities</div>

      <div class="essay">As cultural differences, I think I had more of a social life in Syria.
        You meet friends or neighbours for chatting or having tea every day, spontaneously.
        This doesn’t happen in Germany. You always need an appointment to do so.
        Also, I feel like that I have less time here, perhaps because working hours are really longer.</div>

      <div class="essay">At the moment I have finished a B2 German course and I am applying to a
        vocational school for Media Design. As I took the Graphic Design Fundamental Course at ReDI School
        in summer 2018, I started being interested in design themes and I want to learn more.
        In the future, I want to find a good job as a designer.</div>
