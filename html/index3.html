      <div class="essay">I am Amal, a Palestinian Jordanian woman.
        I work as a consultant at an NGO which has a project for work training called ‘Bridge’.
        It supports refugees and describes work possibilities in Germany.
        We offer consultations to let them find German courses, computer trainings and support for recognition of their certificates.
        The refugees came here with many experiences and studies, and need acceptance in the German job market.</div>

      <div class="essay">I go to work at 7:30 am, check emails and social media to inform people about new job vacancies and promote our project.
        Then I have consulting appointments and document our work afterwards.
        Because we organize job fairs, we have a lot of meetings as well.
        I meet all refugee men and women, adult and youth looking for educational and integration advices.
        One of the challenges is to find an appropriate jobs in the same field for people with some specific academic backgrounds, like lawyers.
        I feel a little bit sorry for them, because they need to start from another field of work…
        Also because of the language skills needed. It takes time for them to speak well.
        Anyway, I like helping people to find their way in Germany.
        When they feel thankful for what I do, I feel so happy!</div>

      <div class="essay">Let me talk about my self-initiated work.
        I am a founder of a non-profit organization that focuses on matters of female refugees in Berlin.
        The aim is to support females who are talented in hand craft to make their production in different sectors.
        Starting from knowledge trainings such as ‘how to start your businesses,’
        we also offer practical trainings like ‘how to improve your products’ and ‘how to do marketing’.
        The scope of the organization allows us to work on many different projects. </div>

      <div class="essay">As a job seeker, a person will choose either working as an employee at a company or earn
        ing as a craftsperson. The Job Center typically is where people go to apply for office jobs.
        As a man, if you are a craftsperson, you can be a carpenter or a plumber.
        However, as a woman it is not so easy.
        I don’t think many organizations support female craftspersons in finding opportunities,
        especially for women who can produce things like design, clothes, and food.
        That’s why I think there is a market opportunity.</div>

      <div class="essay">Since meeting many women from Syria or other middle-eastern countries and even from
        Africa, I have found out that they used to work in their countries to help families.
        They have skills such as knitting, sewing, dyeing clothes, gift making, painting,
        cooking arabic cuisine and so on. They already have experience in producing things and selling them.
        That’s why I would like to support the women to continue their activities.
        At first they could earn money as a side job, then later on they could make their business bigger. </div>

      <div class="essay">As a pilot project, we organized the first exhibition ‘Christmas Party and Gifts Market’
        at WeWork in Berlin. To make it happen, I contacted many people and finally one person asked me to do
        host it. It was very successful! As a next step, I am working to organise workshops to support these
        women to register their businesses. I am now applying for funding for that.</div>

      <div class="essay">I would like to explain my challenges in Germany. Because of my headscarf, people don’t understand me
        from the appearance, so you need to introduce yourself and work to break this wall.
        Thinking about this experience, it is important for me to give a new role to the refugee women.
        They need to have equality to open their voices and to let them have self confidence and establish
        their business. Also I would like to show the German communities that they are strong women,
        they are not here to get money from the government, but they need only a little support and can do
        many things. </div>

      <div class="essay">Integration is not from one side like only doing German courses,
        but should be from the both sides. We have to respect all skills and abilities from all people.
        In this sense my organization is not only for refugee women, but also for German or other
        nationalities’ women to make exchanges in the same field and interest.
        Because Berlin is an open and multicultural city, I think this exchange between all the women
        will be important!</div>
