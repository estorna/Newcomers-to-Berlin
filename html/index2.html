      <div class="essay">In December 2015 I came to Berlin because my husband has relatives here.
        I came here to Berlin with him and our three children, ages: 21, 17 and 10 years old.
        Our route to Berlin was from Damascus, Syria to Beirut, Lebanon and then we flew to Berlin directly from there.
        Our trip was safer than most other people’s because we came through a German organization called Flüchtlingspaten Syrien.
        They help Syrians travel safely on land through Lebanon, instead of taking a dangerous trip by boat.
        In Germany they provide accommodation and give financial support to refugees who cannot go legally through the Job Center.</div>

      <div class="essay">When we arrived in Berlin, we found a very small 2-room apartment.
        Yeah, we didn’t have a lot of options. Back then, the most important thing was that we felt safe.
        Learning German was a challenge for us. I had to go from “Zero to Hero.”
        It was a huge amount of work for me and my husband, but my children learned much faster.</div>

      <div class="essay">After much struggle, I found a part time job as a teacher’s assistant.
        It was an assistant job for English and Mathematic classes at a primary school for refugee kids.
        They are from all backgrounds (from Syria, Iraq, etc) between 7 to 10 years old.
        It was contracted for a year and in the middle of the second year it was terminated.</div>

      <div class="essay">Last summer I taught painting and drawing at a refugee shelter for five hours a week.
        It was a group of 15 girls and boys between 14 and 18 years old.
        These students didn’t think they were talented, but at the end of the course, we put together a great exhibition!
        Although I have already several teaching experiences,
        it is still difficult to teach at a German school because it requires a C2 level of German language.</div>

      <div class="essay">Since last year I am studying at ReDI School of Digital Integration.
        I heard about this school through my student’s mother.
        I first took the Basic Computer course to refresh my knowledge and skills with the computer.</div>

    <div class="story">
      <img src="../images/diana7.png" alt="Diana">
      <div class="essay">Then ReDI introduced me the Graphic Design Fundamentals course.
        It was a hit to me because I used to work also as an art director doing magazine covers.
        The course developed skills and experiences I had in the past.
        But I realized many things are new in digital media and learning it helps me to find jobs, which I enjoy doing.</div>

      <div class="essay">Life is sometimes more up and down than you expect.
        My husband is also struggling to find a job.
        But thankfully we always have great support from a German person, whom we got known through Flüchtlingspaten Syrien.
        He supported us coming over here and guided us how to deal with all administrations.
        Among other things he treats us like a family, which is a great pleasure for us.</div>

      <div class="essay">As a female in Berlin, I realized that men and women are “on the same stage.”
        I am happy about this and my husband is also supportive to help in the household and to look after the children.
        I heard from other females that it is not always the same case, though.
        I also had a chance to talk about my experience with an organization “Tür Öffner” in a radio channel</div>

      <div class="essay">At the moment, I got a job opportunity as a job coach for refugees, but I think this is not a permanent job for my future.
        It is important to establish my life in Germany and support my home country from here.
        So, my dream is I would like to be a graphic designer and then to start an art school for newcomers!</div>
